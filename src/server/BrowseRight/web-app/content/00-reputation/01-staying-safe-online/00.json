Regulating what we put up can protect us from identity theft and possible physical danger.\\n\\nConsider this: you post information concerning an upcoming trip you will be taking. A man who lives near you now knows that your home will be vacant. Were you to have monitored who saw what you posted, you could have prevented the robbery that occurred while you were enjoying your vacation.\\n\\nYou may say this is unrealistic, but the truth is that many people put themselves in danger while posting seemingly harmless information.\\n\\n* Never post personal information.\\n* Never freely give out personal information.\\n* Monitor who can see your information, and make sure that they will not share it.\\n\\nThe Internet if full of people who would love to hurt your reputation by stealing your information; stay one step ahead."
