Likely, that person was attempting to use your information to steal your identity or gain access to personal accounts.\\n\\nWhat can be done?\\n\\n* Call the company to verify that it is legitimate.\\n* Never send sensitive information (like passwords) through email.\\n* Avoid giving out information that may help the person find out who you are.\\n* Do not click on links in emails. Go to the website directly instead.\\n* Delete anything suspicious; it is better to be cautious than to have your identity stolen.\\n* Be careful where you sign up with your email online. Not every site can be trusted! \\n\\nWhat if you have given out information?\\n\\n* Report the person or company that took your information. If you feel that this person is a threat to others, you can report him or her to the Federal Trade Commission (United States) or your own local agency that handles identity theft.\\n* Change your passwords as soon as possible.\\n* Watch out for anything that suggests that the person is using your information.\\n\\nRemember that once one has your information, he or she can assume your identity and quickly hurt your online (and offline) reputation."
