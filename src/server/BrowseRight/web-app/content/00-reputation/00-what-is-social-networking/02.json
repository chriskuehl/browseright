	"text": "Now you are ready to start enjoying social networking. But what if you see someone post something private about you. Assuming that it isnâ€™t hurtful (which we will cover later), you may want to ask that the person take it down. Remember, it is often our friends who pose a threat to our online reputation.\\n\\n* Calmly visit the person. It may be better to speak to him or her in person if possible.\\n* Make sure that he or she knows the photo or piece of text in question.\\n* Try to resolve it with that person.\\n* If trouble persists, contact the customer support at the social networking site.\\n\\nIt is very important to know that anyone may be able to see what is posted about you on a site like Facebook or Twitter. In fact, a future employer may choose to not hire you after looking for information about you online."
