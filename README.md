BrowseRight
===========

BrowseRight is an iPad app for teaching students to be responsible digital citizens. Students read short lessons
and then complete quizzes to prove their learning.

BrowseRight can be used by schools to educate students and to help satisfy CIPA law requirements mandating that
schools teach students about digital citizenship.

Apps are available for the following platforms:

* iPad [(app store)](https://itunes.apple.com/app/browseright/id625903248?ign-mpt=uo%3D6&mt=8)

The website can be viewed at [browseright.org](https://browseright.org/).

### Technologies
BrowseRight consists of two main parts:

1. A server web application written using the [Grails](http://grails.org/) web framework
2. A series of device-specific applications (currently only available for the iPad) written primarily in JavaScript
using the [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) app framework.

We use a lot of JavaScript libraries in our client applications, the primary ones being jQuery and jQuery UI (not
jQuery Mobile). Many others are also used (see the `js/lib` folder).
